# Visualise how Vector Embeddings look like in a 3D space
## This tool will help you understand how Vector Embeddings for tokens are actually placed, and how similar sentences have vectors that are closer to each other

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies
3. Run the vectory_visualizer.py
4. You can change the 'sentences' list to add you own words and test it out yourself.
